IDEA FOR PROJECT:

Turn based RPG with team members. Each team member has a unique weapon and ability, and so do the enemies. The Players, and Enemies will have their own classes
to track what weapons they have, what hp they have, and to add functions to deal damage and to attack. Enemies moves will be random, like: using an attack,
healing a team member, or defending/shielding. There will be no art because I just want it to be a simple text game.

NOTE: Actually, this will be my unit 10, 11 and 12 project. Unit 9 should be simpler, just more of a test, so I will instead do a dumbed down version where its just one player, and one
enemy. You customize the player classes, and the enemy classes. Choose a player (which is from a list of objects made form the class). And you just press
either attack, defend, or heal. While the enemy just does random moves.

Unit 10 will bring more mechanics, like make it an actual playable rpg with a team.

Unit 11 will probably be more of a UI upgrade, and responsiveness upgrade. Maybe some new features here and there but I'll see

Unit 12 will put some polish into it and make it a shippable product. Game name, fake developer team name, I don't really know what it wants from me to make it
what they call a "shippable product". Maybe mobile responsiveness? Difficulty modes? Tutorial screen? I'll see.

And I think when im all done I'll start UI/UX. I like programming, but I had more fun with designing. I think if I want to continue programming ill probably
start learning either Java 25, or Luau. They seem more fun to me, javascript isn't really my thing.
